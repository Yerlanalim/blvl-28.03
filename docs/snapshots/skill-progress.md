# Skill Progress System Snapshot

## Purpose
Calculate, visualize, and provide recommendations for user's business skill development

## Key Files
- `/lib/services/skill-service.ts` - Skill calculation service
- `/components/features/profile/SkillProgressSection.tsx` - Skill visualization
- `/components/features/profile/SkillRecommendations.tsx` - Recommendations component
- Modified files:
  - `/lib/services/progress-service.ts` - Integration with progress tracking
  - `/hooks/useProgress.ts` - Exposing skill calculations to components
  - `/app/(routes)/profile/page.tsx` - Updated profile page with new components

## State Management
- Skill definitions and metadata stored in service
- Skill progress calculated based on completed levels
- Progress values stored in user progress record
- React hooks provide formatted skill data to components

## Data Flow
1. Level completion triggers skill progress recalculation
2. Progress service stores updated skill values
3. useProgress hook provides formatted skill data
4. Profile components visualize skill progress
5. Recommendation engine suggests levels for improvement

## Key Decisions
- Six core skill categories covering key business competencies
- Color-coded skill visualization for clarity
- Multi-format visualization (progress bars and dots)
- Points-based progression system (10 points per level)
- Personalized recommendations based on skill gaps

## Usage Example
```tsx
import { useProgress } from '@/hooks/useProgress';
import { SkillProgressSection } from '@/components/features/profile/SkillProgressSection';

function SkillsDisplay() {
  const { getFormattedSkillProgress } = useProgress();
  
  return (
    <SkillProgressSection skills={getFormattedSkillProgress()} />
  );
}
```
