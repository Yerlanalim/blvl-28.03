# Progress Tracking System

## Overview
This document describes the progress tracking system, which manages user progress through the learning platform including video views, test completions, artifact downloads, level completion, and skill development.

## Components

### 1. Progress Service
- Centralized service for all progress-related operations
- Handles data persistence (localStorage in MVP, Firestore in production)
- Provides atomic operations for updating different aspects of progress
- Manages skill progress calculation and badge awards

### 2. Progress Hook
- React hook for accessing progress data and operations
- Provides loading, updating, and error states
- Exposes functions for tracking various user actions
- Includes helper functions for checking completion status

### 3. Debug Panel
- Administrative component for testing progress functionality
- Displays current progress state
- Allows resetting progress for testing
- Shows level status, skill progress, and earned badges

## Progress Tracking Types

### 1. Video Tracking
- Tracks which videos have been watched
- Stores progress position within videos
- Auto-marks videos as watched at 90% completion
- Records completion timestamp

### 2. Test Tracking
- Tracks completed tests
- Stores test scores and answers
- Records completion timestamp
- Used for level completion requirements

### 3. Artifact Tracking
- Tracks downloaded artifacts
- Used for level completion requirements
- Updates artifact download count statistics

### 4. Level Completion
- Marks levels as completed
- Updates skill progress based on level focus
- Unlocks next level
- Triggers badge awarding check

### 5. Skill Progress
- Tracks progress across six skill categories
- Updates based on completed levels
- Visualized in profile and debug panel
- Used for personalization and achievement tracking

### 6. Badges
- Awarded based on user achievements
- Triggers on level completion and other milestones
- Displayed in profile and debug panel

## Implementation Details

### Data Persistence
- MVP: Uses localStorage for persistence between sessions
- Production: Will use Firestore for cloud storage and synchronization
- Structured to allow easy migration between storage systems

### User Flow
1. User interacts with content (watches video, takes test, etc.)
2. Action is tracked via relevant hook function
3. Progress is updated in service and persisted
4. UI components react to progress changes
5. Badges are awarded when criteria are met

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized to minimize unnecessary updates
- Loading states to handle asynchronous operations
- Caching to reduce storage operations
